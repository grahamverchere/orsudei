    <h2><i>Girotia</i>, Orien States</h2>
    <p>Here are the main districts explored so far:</p>
      <ul>
        <p class="ul-list-title"><strong>Districts</strong></p>
        <li><b>Furnace District:</b> This is the center of town, with the city hall and a massive forge.</li>
        <li><b>Northside:</b> This is a bit of a sketchier neighbourhood, but it still has its nicer areas.</li>
        <li><b>Hearthlight:</b> Although we haven't referred to it by this name or explored it to any extent, Hearthlight is the neighbourhood through which the party arrived in Girotia. It's also the neighbourhood that contains Michael's former house, now headquarters to the Haven Collective.</li>
        <br>
      </ul>
      <p>How does text continue after a list? <br> Does it have a similar effect to this?</p>
      <p>
        Do line breaks stack? They do! But now, although I suspect it doesn't, I wonder if a <a id="color1" href="https://watabou.github.io/city-generator">link</a> interrupts the flow text?
        How about if I insert a <a href="https://watabou.itch.io/neighbourhood">link</a> in separate lines? I'm not sure if that's proper form or not though. It looks like it adds a space after "link" when it's in separate lines. Let's keep it inline for now.
